1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

2. Update the `.env.local` file with your Supabase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_public_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_secret_key_here
```

## 4. Create the Database Schema

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy the content from `database/schema.sql` and run it
3. This will create:
   - `leads` table with all necessary fields
   - Indexes for performance
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Triggers for automatic timestamp updates
   - Analytics view for reporting

## 5. Test Your Setup

1. Start your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Go to your contact page: `http://localhost:3000/en/contact`
3. Fill out and submit the contact form
4. Check your Supabase dashboard â†’ **Table Editor** â†’ `leads` to see the new entry!

## 9. Monitoring & Maintenance

### Check Lead Activity

```sql
-- View recent leads
SELECT * FROM leads
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Lead analytics by day
SELECT * FROM lead_analytics
WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Update Lead Status

```sql
-- Mark lead as contacted
UPDATE leads
SET status = 'contacted'
WHERE id = 'lead-uuid-here';
```

## 10. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Cannot find module '@supabase/supabase-js'"**: Run `npm install @supabase/supabase-js zod`
2. **"Missing Supabase environment variables"**: Check your `.env.local` file
3. **"new row violates row-level security policy"**: This is an RLS permission issue. Run the SQL commands in `database/fix-rls.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor
4. **"Permission denied"**: Verify your RLS policies in Supabase
5. **"Network error"**: Check your Supabase project URL and API keys

### RLS Permission Fix:

If you get RLS policy violations, run this in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Run the content from database/fix-rls.sql
-- This will fix permission issues with anonymous users
```

### Debug Mode:

Add console logging to see API responses:

```javascript
console.log('Lead submission result:', result);
```
